# 🗂 IT Support Toolkit Documentation

This folder contains support documentation and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) designed to accompany the PowerShell scripts in the [IT Support Toolkit](../). These SOPs help IT technicians, especially those in restaurant and retail environments, perform common troubleshooting and support workflows with clarity and consistency.

Each SOP reflects real-world scenarios and outlines practical steps using the toolkit's scripts for fast and effective remote support.
