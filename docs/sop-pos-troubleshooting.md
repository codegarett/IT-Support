Remote POS Terminal Troubleshooting SOP
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a repeatable, efficient process for remotely diagnosing and resolving performance issues on Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals ‚Äî commonly used in restaurants and retail environments.

Designed to work hand-in-hand with the PowerShell scripts in your IT Support Toolkit, this SOP targets scenarios where registers are reported as:

Lagging or freezing

Unresponsive when cashing out

Experiencing memory or performance degradation

The SOP is structured for remote technicians using tools like Splashtop, AnyDesk, or ConnectWise to access Windows-based POS systems.

üîç What This SOP Covers:
Gathering system info using a diagnostic script

Cleaning temporary files and user profile junk

Scanning for recent application/system errors

Rebooting the system safely if needed

Logging the resolution for ticket documentation

It empowers support techs to respond quickly without guesswork and restores system performance while minimizing restaurant downtime.

‚úÖ Why It Matters
POS systems are critical infrastructure for restaurants. Even brief disruptions can result in:

Slowed customer service

Lost revenue

Staff frustration

This SOP ensures techs can confidently support frontline operations by performing:

Proactive maintenance (temp cleanup, log scanning)

Root-cause diagnostics (error logs, system info)

Tactical resolutions (safe reboots, profile resets)

It can be applied consistently across multiple locations and helps standardize how restaurant IT support is delivered.
